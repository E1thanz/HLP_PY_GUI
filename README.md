## HLP_PY_GUI
simple tkinter gui for representing hex layers  
text representation is:  
first is the comparator that gets its value from the side  
put an asterix "*" if its on subtract or a blank space " " if its on compare  
after that put the barrel value in hexadecimal and a comma ","  
then do the same thing for the other comparator that gets its value from the input  
and top it off with a semicolon ";"  
example: " A,*2;*F, 9;"  
for multiple layers just put the next layer's values after the semicolon

to open the gui just run the file called HLPWindow.py  
you can read the small amount of comments i wrote in it and change some parameters if you want to  
mess with it.

**good luck!**
